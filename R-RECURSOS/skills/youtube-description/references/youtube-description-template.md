## Section Guidelines

### Hook
- ONE sentence max. Conversational, not salesy.
- Lead with the outcome or curiosity gap — never "In this video..."
- Good: "I automated my entire content pipeline with one Claude prompt."
- Bad: "Stop wasting hours on tasks AI can do in minutes. Here's exactly how I automated my entire content pipeline using Claude."

### Context
- ONE sentence. Who is this for + what problem it solves. That's it.
- Good: "If you're a solopreneur still doing this stuff manually, this will save you hours."
- Bad: Long multi-sentence explanations of the problem space.

### What You'll Learn
- 3 bullets max (4 only if absolutely necessary)
- Short — each bullet is one line, not a paragraph
- Each starts with an action verb (Build, Automate, Set up, Deploy, etc.)
- Conversational, not formal — write how Remy talks

### Newsletter CTA
- MUST appear early — before YouTube's "show more" truncation (~150 chars on mobile)
- Placed right after "What You'll Learn" to maximize visibility

### Links Mentioned
- Research and find public URLs for tools and resources mentioned in the video
- Ask user for any links that can't be found via web search
- Include ALL tools, platforms, and resources referenced

### Timestamps
- Generated from Whisper transcript segment timestamps
- Identify major topic shifts in the transcript
- Format: M:SS or MM:SS
- First entry always starts at 0:00
- Aim for 5-10 timestamp entries depending on video length

### Tone
- Casual, builder-to-builder
- Honest, anti-hype
- Sounds like Remy, not a corporate channel
